  * Check user for permissions when inserting data. Only authentication was 
    checked, not if the user had 'insert' privileges. (issue #16)
    
  * Minor performance updates by creating macros for frequently used
    functions. (see issue #17 for more info)
    
  * Store reference counter for a series object in an uint32_t. This solves 
    a bug on big endian systems. (issue #18)
    
  * Remove server_id and idx_tp from series object and set those as flags.
    This removed the unneeded pads and saves 8 bytes for each series object.
    
  * Honor ip_support setting when sending a dns request. (issue #19)
  
  * Fixed a bug in listing and counting servers when using one of the 
    properties 'sync_progress' or 'reindex_progress'. (issue #20)
    
  * Fixed a bug when a select query is using a greater start time than end
    time. Instead of trying to answer to the query we now respond with an 
    error informing the user the given query is not allowed. (issue #21) 
    
  * Fixed type in log message.
  
  * Fixed bug in median (and median_low, median_high) when applying on a large
    data set. (issue #22)
    
  * Improve median, median_high and median_low algorithm. (see issue #23)
  
  * Fixed bug in 'drop series' statement. (reported by Koos Joosten, issue #24)
  
  * Fixed bug in creating a new replica. Possible data loss could occur when
    creating a new replica. (see issue #25)
    
  * Fixed bug in dropping items from the internal compact tree. (issue #26)
