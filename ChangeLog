siridb-server (2.0.2) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Check user for permissions when inserting data. Only authentication was 
    checked, not if the user had 'insert' privileges. (issue #16)
    
  * Minor performance updates by creating macros for frequently used
    functions. (see issue #17 for more info)
    
  * Store reference counter for a series object in an uint32_t. This solves 
    a bug on big endian systems. (issue #18)
    
  * Remove server_id and idx_tp from series object and set those as flags.
    This removed the unneeded pads and saves 8 bytes for each series object.
    
  * Honor ip_support setting when sending a dns request. (issue #19)
  
  * Fixed a bug in listing and counting servers when using one of the 
    properties 'sync_progress' or 'reindex_progress'. 
    (reported by Koos Joosten, issue #20)
    
  * Fixed a bug when a select query is using a greater start time than end
    time. Instead of trying to answer to the query we now respond with an 
    error informing the user the given query is not allowed. 
    (reported by Koos Joosten, issue #21) 
    
  * Fixed typo in log message.
  
  * Fixed bug in median (and median_low, median_high) when applying on a large
    data set. (reported by Koos Joosten, issue #22)
    
  * Improve median, median_high and median_low algorithm. (see issue #23)
  
  * Fixed bug in 'drop series' statement. (reported by Koos Joosten, issue #24)
  
  * Fixed bug in creating a new replica. Possible data loss could occur when
    creating a new replica. (see issue #25)
    
  * Fixed bug in dropping items from the internal compact tree. 
    (reported by Koos Joosten, issue #26)

siridb-server (2.0.1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Only try to load a database from a directory containing at least the
    files 'database.conf' and 'database.dat'. This prevents trying to load
    from directories like lost+found etc. (issue #1)
    
  * Increased UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE from four to eight and prevent SiriDB
    from loading more than four databases. (issue #2)
    
  * Removed unneeded msgpack.h dependency. (issue #3)
  
  * To prevent compile warning on 32-bit linux we now cast int64_t and uint64_t
    to "lld" (long long) and "llu" (unsigned long long). (issue #4)  
    
  * Dependencies in cleri (with siridb) are removed. (issue #5)
  
  * Respond with BPROTO_AUTH_ERR_UNKNOWN_UUID in case the authentication 
    request contains the servers own UUID. (issue #6)
    
  * Added CPROTO_REQ_FILE_GROUPS to type translate function. (issue #7)
  
  * Added support for an optimize interval of zero which disables the 
    optimize task. (enhancement issue #8)
    
  * Implemented configuration file changes (see issue #9)
  
  * Fixed resolving an ip address for a given hostname or fqdn. (for more
    information see issue #10)
    
  * Fixed writing uninitialized data while enabling or disabling backup mode
    by setting the correct package size. (issue #11)
    
  * Accept a variable %HOSTNAME in the configuration file. This is now used
    for the default value, 'server_name = %HOSTNAME:9010'. (issue #12)

  * Parse ipv6 addresses given in the configuration file correctly.
    (see issue #13)
    
  * Added support for ipv6 while discovering an address using dns. (issue #14)
  
  * Added property 'ip_support' to the grammar so we can view the current 
    setting with 'show' and 'list servers'. (issue #15)

  * Initial C-implementation of SiriDB. This improves the overall performance
    and at the same time is more robuust.
